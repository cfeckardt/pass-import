A <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a> extension for importing data from most of the existing password manager.
</p>

## Description
`pass import` is a password store extension allowing you to conveniently
import your password database to a password store repository. It natively
supports import from 18 different password managers. More manager support can
easily be added.

Passwords are imported into the existing default password store, therefore
the password store must have been initialized with `pass init` before running `pass import`.

By default pass imports entries at the root of the password store and only keeps
the main data (password, login, email, url, group). This behavior can be changed
using the provided options.

Pass import handles duplicates and is compatible with [browserpass][bp].

**The following password managers are supported:**

| **Password Manager** | **How to export Data** | **Command line** |
|:--------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| [1password][1password] | *Select all items [Ctrl+A]: Click Right> Settings> Export: CSV* | `pass import 1password file.csv` |
| [1passwordpif][1passwordpif] | *Select all items [Ctrl+A]: Click Right> Settings> Export: PIF* | `pass import 1password file.pif` |

## Usage

```
usage: pass import [-h] [-V] [[-p PATH] [-c] [-e] [-f] | -l] [manager] [file]

  Imports data from most of password managers. Passwords
  are imported in the existing default password store, therefore
  the password store must have been initialized with 'pass init' before using `pass import`

positional arguments:
  manager               Can be: 1password, 1password4, 1passwordpif, chrome, dashlane,
                        enpass, fpm, gorilla, kedpm, keepass, keepasscsv,
                        keepassx, keepassxc, lastpass, passwordexporter,
                        pwsafe, revelation, roboform.
  file                  File is the path to the file that contains the data to
                        import, if empty read the data from stdin.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PATH, --path PATH  Import the passwords to a specific subfolder.
  -c, --clean           Clean data before import.
  -e, --extra           Also import all the extra data present.
  -l, --list            List the supported password managers.
  -f, --force           Overwrite existing path.
  -q, --quiet           Be quiet.
  -v, --verbose         Be verbose.
  -V, --version         Show the program version and exit.

More information may be found in the pass-import(1) man page.
```

See `man pass-import` for more information.

## Examples
**Import password from KeePass**
```
pass import keepass keepass.xml
(*) Importing passwords from keepass
 .  File: keepass.xml
 .  Number of password imported: 6
 .  Passwords imported:
       Social/mastodon.social
       Social/twitter.com
       Social/news.ycombinator.com
       Servers/ovh.com
       Servers/ovh.com0
       Bank/aib
```

**Import password to a different password store**
```
export PASSWORD_STORE_DIR="~/.mypassword-store"
pass init <gpg-id>
pass import keepass keepass.xml
```

**Import password to a subfolder**
```
pass import keepass keepass.xml -p Import/
(*) Importing passwords from keepass
 .  File: db/keepass.xml
 .  Root path: Import
 .  Number of password imported: 6
 .  Passwords imported:
      Import/Social/mastodon.social
      Import/Social/twitter.com
      Import/Social/news.ycombinator.com
      Import/Servers/ovh.com
      Import/Servers/ovh.com0
      Import/Bank/aib
```

## Security consideration

Passwords should generally not be written in a plain text form on the drive.
Therefore when possible you should pipe your passwords to pass import:
```sh
my_password_manager_export_cmd | pass import keepass
```

Otherwise, if your password manager does not have this command line option, you
should take care of securely removing the plain text password database:
```sh
pass import lastpass data.csv
srm data.csv
```

You might also want to update the passwords imported using [`pass-update`][update].

## Installation

**Requirements**
* `pass 1.7.0` or greater.
* `python3` (python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 are supported)
* `python-defusedxml`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3-defusedxml`
  - OSX: `pip3 install python-defusedxml`
* If you do not want to install this extension as system extension, you need to
enable user extension with `PASSWORD_STORE_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS=true pass`. You can
create an alias in `.bashrc`: `alias pass='PASSWORD_STORE_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS=true pass'`
