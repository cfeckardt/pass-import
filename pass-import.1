.TH MARK 1 "January 2018" "pass-import"

.SH NAME
\fBpass import\fP - A \fIpass\fP(1) extension for importing data from most of
the existing password manager.


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpass import\fP [-h] [-V] [[-p PATH] [-c] [-e] [-f] | -l] [manager] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpass import\fP is a password store extension allowing you to conveniently
import your password database to a password store repository. It natively
supports imports from 18 different password managers. More manager support can
easily be added.

Passwords are imported in the existing default password store, therefore
the password store must have been initialized with \fBpass init\fP before running \fBpass import\fP.

By default pass, imports entries at the root of the password store and only keeps
the main data (password, login, email, url, group). This behavior can be changed
using the provided options.

Pass import handles duplicates and is compatible with \fIbrowserpass\fP.

.SH COMMAND
.TP
\fBpass import\fP [ \fI--path <path>\fP, \fI-p <path>\fP ] [ \fI--clean\fP, \fI-c\fP ]
     [ \fI--extra\fP, \fI-e\fP ] [\fI--list\fP, \fI-l\fP] [ \fI--force\fP, \fI-f\fP ]
     [ \fI--quiet\fP, \fI-q\fP ] [ \fI--verbose\fP, \fI-v\fP ] \fImanager\fP \fIfile\fP

Import data from most of the password manager. Passwords are imported in the
existing default password store, therefore the password store must has been
initialized before with \fIpass init\fP.

.I manager
refer to one of the supported password manager from which you want to import
your data. The complete list of supported manager can be found in the section
\fISUPPORTED MANAGERS\fP.

.I file
is the path to the file that contains the data to import. If file is not
present, pass-import will read the data from stdin.

Specific root directory to use in the password store can be given using
\fI--path\fP or \fI-p\fP is specified, along with a argument.

If \fI--clean\fP or \fI-c\fP is specified, clean the password path in order to
be more command line friendly.

If \fI--extra\fP or \fI-e\fP is specified, conserve and import all the data
present in the backup file. Otherwise, only title, password, login, url,
comments and group data are imported.

If \fI--list\fP or \fI-l\fP is specified, print the list of the available
password manager.

If \fI--force\fP or \fI-f\fP is specified, the import process will overwrite
existing password entry if it already exist.

.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATION

.TP
Passwords should generally not be written in a plain text form on the drive. Therefore when possible you should pipe your passwords to pass import:

.B zx2c4@laptop ~ $ my_password_manger_export_cmd | pass import keepass

.TP
Otherwise, if your password manager does not have this command line option, you should take care of securely removing the plain text password database:

.B zx2c4@laptop ~ $ pass import lastpass data.csv
.br
.B zx2c4@laptop ~ $ srm data.csv

.TP
You might also want to update the passwords imported using \fBpass update\fP.
